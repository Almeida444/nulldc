# nulldc
nullDC was a sega dreamcast emulator for win86 and is now archived at 
[github](https://github.com/skmp/nulldc)

Work is now done on [reicast](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator), 
and while nullDC is still a better choice for dreamcast emulation on windows/x86 
reicast is where future development is. Come and help us!

Cheers,
